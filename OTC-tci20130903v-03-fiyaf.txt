I will start it. You little ones here, stay quiet! Don't talk! Daddy's recording the story. Don't talk!

I left here the day before yesterday, on Saturday. As I got walking, I called the dogs. I told the baby's mother that I am going this way for Gastol fish. I walked to the big canoe place and went across. One of the dogs was romping around. I came back and grabbed it and dumped the dog in the water. Then I threw it up on the floating grass. Then got going from there. On the side, I called him and called him, but nothing happened. Then I set off and walked to \textit{Fétérsam}. I waited there for some while, but the dog didn't show up. I set off again. I walked until \textit{Büdisén}. At \textit{Büdisén}, I heard Steven and the others. They were catching fish with poison-root. They called out for me, but I didn't not answer them. I just kept walking.

I went up until \textit{Mämbri} and turned into the forest there. As I was walking in the forest and the dogs caught a wallaby. They held it and then they killed it. I made a carrying stick and I set off. I walked further. There is another small creek in the middle that divides \textit{Mämbri} forest and comes back this way. \textit{Bömät Fér} is located on the other side. There is a creek in between. I saw a goanna there. I began to chase the goanna. It went inside a hole. I walked there and put my bow on the side. I cut a stick for poking (into the hole). I started digging for the goanna. I poked into it and I saw (the goanna) there. I poked some more. Then I cut a small bamboo and tried to stab it. I stabbed it and the goanna came out. It came out and I killed it with the bushknife, with this bushknife here. Then I went to where the bow was lying and I started walked again. I put down the goanna and slinged it to the carrying stick. I put it in the bag. I put the bow my the shoulder and set off.

I walked to \textit{Bömät Fér}. As I was walking in the forest, the dogs were chasing a deer. But the deer escaped out of the forest and the dogs came back. I continued walking down. I hung up the bag with the goanna and all those things over there. I looked around for gastol fish. I saw Steven and their footprints (and said) ``Oh, they came here already.'' So I returned and rolled a smoke. Then I departed. I walked up to the high ground. I went down and went up again to the high ground at \textit{Méndüfi}. There is another small creek there that's going to \textit{Sazäthi}. I saw gastol fish there. I tried to spear it without success. I took my bushknife and I cut through the water with the knife. I caught two fish. I threw the two fish on the ground and killed them properly. I caught some more gastol fish. Then I followed the creek upstream up until there was no more water in it. Then I returned to the place where the bow was lying. I cut some of the bushrope. I slinged those things and put the in the bag and hung it on the bow. I set off.

I came to that place, whatisname, to the other creek. It's at the end of \textit{Sazäthi} creek. What's it called? \textit{Findath Fér} or \textit{Findath Zéféth} creek. I saw Steven's footprints there (and thought) ``Oh, he must have caught fish here already.'' So I walked on and collected some tree bark. I peeled them off and piled up firewood. I put a grill over the fire. I cut the small bamboo and tied up the gastol fish. I took off the scales and tied it up. Then I put it on the grill. I also burned off the skin of the goanna and cut it into pieces. I put it on the grill as well. I cooked some cassawas. Then I began scraping the cassawa tubers. While I was scraping them, I kept turning those gastol fish. The goanna was on the other side. I took them out of the fire. Only one gastol fish was done. I took the gastol fish out of the bamboo case. I put it down, peeled the bark and put it beside. I started eating the cassawa, and the gastol fish. I knocked off the tail of the goanna and ate it. The sun was about there (and I thought) ``Oh, it's getting late.'' I ate up the fish quickly and finished all. I went down to the creek and drank some water there. I came back and rolled my tobacco.

I put the things on the carrying stick. I slinged them and put then on bow. Then I rushed off. I came back to \textit{Mämbri} forest. I walked down to \textit{Mämbri} creek and checked for water. But there wasn't any. I set off from there and came to \textit{Büdisén}. I went up to the high ground. I broke off two banksia flowers and put them in the bag. I rushed off and came to \textit{Büdisén}. I took off the bags and put down the bow. I drank water over there. I walked with the bow and carrying stick in my hand and came to \textit{Büdisén}. I checked there for (Steven and his family), but they weren't there. They left already for \textit{Kanathér}. Steven went from here and the children came this way. So I came too late. I followed them until I came to \textit{Fétérsam}. Srik's house is here. The night caught up with me there. I arrived at the large canoe site in the dark. I called the dog that I thrown in the water earlier in the day. I called, but without success. So I got into the canoe with the two dogs. Then I pushed out the canoe out and paddled across to the other side. I rolled a cigarette and set off.

I came here. I arrived at the house. I asked them about the dog. I asked the mother ``Did the dog show up here?'' She replied ``This one arrived earlier.'' I explained: ``That dog was mucking around there and that's why I pushed him under water. He ran here in fear.'' Then I unloaded the things and took a rest.

That was the story. Thank you very much.
