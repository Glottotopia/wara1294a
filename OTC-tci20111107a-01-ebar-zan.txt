The people who lived (in \textit{Firra}) before had names. I only know the ones my fathers have mentioned. So I will only mention them. Many people from the Mayawa used to live there. They belonged to the Mayawa clan or were elders of the Mayawa. Yasi, my grandfather, and Srank. They were from the Mayawa clan. The Bangu were numerous. One of the Bangu elders who lived there was Mawoi. And there was Béthi of the Sangara. Okay, there were a lot of people within these three clans in \textit{Firra} village.

At this time, a headhunt was taking place in \textit{Firra}. Those who did this came from Mere. The ones from Mere have joined forces with the Wartha people. Others cames from Nzrari. Nowadays, they call them \textit{Safés} people, including the ones living at Nzrari. These were the men who killed the people at \textit{Firra}.

When that headhunting raid took place, my grandfather Yasi, my father was a young baby boy, he left in the afternoon. He knew that ``They will kill them today.'' (He left) with his own wife. His wife's name was Noko, a girl from \textit{Mata}. The child, my father, was Kwozi. They set off together very late in the afternoon when the sun was going down. He has already worked it out with his own magic. (He thought) something like this: "Today the killing will come here" or ``They will kill the people today in \textit{Firra}.'' He tried to tell Srank, ``Srank, let's go!'' Srank said: ``No, it's already late in the day. I'll come tomorrow.'' Then Yasi really went to \textit{Masu}. He thought of the people in \textit{Masu}, Karémbu and Ote, who lived over there, these ancestors. Koyä and Tétéfér, the elders of the Mayawa. With this goal in mind, he set off in the afternoon.

The headhunters arrived at night. They were already blocking the space for the attack. They surrounded the village and came in at night and killed them. As for Srank and his little brother,  they struck him down. But they did not kill him. They looked around for the small bamboo with which they wanted to cut his neck. When they returned to look for the bamboo knife, Srank ran off. They had already killed his little brother. Srank thought only of Yasi. He followed Yasi to \textit{Masu}. (On the way) he told everyone: ``They have already killed them in \textit{Firra}.'' Then he shouted at the river in \textit{Masu} from the other side. Yasi said to Karémbu ``Srank is shouting there. Take the canoe for him! I tried to take him with me yesterday. These headhunters nearly killed him.'' So Srank survived, but he didn't leave any children behind. Back then, when they ran away and left, other people had settled there, for example people from \textit{Safés}. There was a man from \textit{Safés} by the name of Géfi. His father was Bamu, but they actually come from Thémbithé. (Géfi) he had left already. He knew there would be an attack. So he left. That's why they (his children) are still alive. If he had stayed, he would have been killed along with others. The other people in \textit{Firra}, people from other villages who had lived there, were also killed and mixed with them. Only those two survived, Srank and Yasi. We go back to Yasi; from that time until today. Our fathers were Kwozi and Maiti. (This family line) survived, but Srank died later without leaving children. He did get married, but the poor chap had no children. 

There was another woman in that headhunting raid. Her name was Zafo. Zafo was from Akrimongo. She used magic and hid in the hole of a long yam. The headhunters simply missed her. When the headhunters had passed,  she came out of the long yam hole (and ran) to Akrimongo. She told the Akrimongo people ``They've already killed Mawoi.'' Mawoi was an elder from \textit{Firra}. ``They've already got Mawoi.'' That's how they found out: ``Oh, they killed them in \textit{Firra}.'' As for their revenge, that came much later. They should have stopped the headhunters at the river, but they had already crossed the river. The woman had heard their names. Some were talking in Wära language. Some talked in Wartha and Kánchá. She heard one guy speaking Wära, a man who prevented the others from killing his sister (saying) "That's my sister is over there. Don't mix her up with the others!" From this young woman the knowledge spread (and people said) ``Okay, they did not come from far away to kill them. There are from close by, from \textit{Safés}, from \textit{Nzrari}.''

Well, the revenge that took place was the payback for \textit{Firra}. Our grandfathers payed them back and also Ote whose (grandson) is now the councillor, brother Marua, Kadikafu and the whole family. Okay, they took revenge because all their Mayawa elders were killed at \textit{Firra}. Those cut-off heads would be avenged. They did not go far for their revenge. They were about to go to Mere. They almost took revenge on the people from Mere. But they decided to turn around and kill the \textit{Safés} people at \textit{Nzrari}. They surrounded them there and killed them. That was the revenge. This is what happened during the \textit{Firra} headhunt.

From then on, the hunting raids came to an end. What they did in the headhunt, they killed the people, cut off their heads and carried them to the village. This incident that was the second last headhunt. The very last one, where they killed people, took place at \textit{Fethka}. When they killed the people of \textit{Fethka}, the (survivors) ran away forever. From this point on, headhunting was over. That is why we are alive today. We are many children now. But this headhunting story, whoever may tell it, when we or others retell it, you just need to look inside our village, in the middle of Morehead. I can tell you, in the middle of Morehead, those are the villages (where people came from). We are not many people, because this happened in our midst. People killed each other. One groups of villagers attacked other villages, and again another group of villagers attacked other villagers. Okay, that is what we have done. This custom was common with us. We were part of that. We come from that clan. The \textit{Firra} headhunt really finished off these other clans. This is the story about the \textit{Firra} headhunt. Nobody could escape there, only we could escape. From Yasi's family to us today.  We are from Yasi's family. (We are) his children. We go back to his ancestors. We know about this in our family. Fortunately, Ote and Karémbu had stayed here. If they had been there at \textit{Firra}, they would have been killed too, and we would not be many people today. Because those two were staying here, Yasi thought of them, really his own clan, he came back, he ran really. My father was the only (son).

The story of the \textit{Firra's} headhunt ends here. It is not a long story. At that time it ended in the last days (of headhunting). Like I just told you. This happened in the last days (of headhunting). This happened when the white man came and also when the missionaries arrived. After that, the headhunting ended. They started throwing people in prison who had killed someone. This story is now over.
