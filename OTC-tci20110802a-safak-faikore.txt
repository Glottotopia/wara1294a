Good morning! A happy morning is coming. The wind is blowing. The village is looking very good. Happiness is coming back today. This morning I will tell a story about the Saratoga man and the Bushfowl man. As for the Saratoga man, he was the Sangaras' story man, the Sangaras from \textit{Garaita}. The Bushfowl man was the Mayawas' story man, the Mayawas from \textit{Masu}. The story that is coming, that I will tell, comes from the ancestors. They told that story to my father Bäi, and my father Bäi told me the story. He was talking like this: ``This is the place here. The saratoga fishlings were inside here. Those two were fighting right here. The stone bridge at \textit{Kanathér}, that was time when they destroyed it. The stone crossed from one side (of the river) to the other side.'' Okay, I will tell this story now. I will start this story now in these morning hours.

There were two men. Just like I was saying before: It is about the Sangara, about the \textit{Garaita} Sangaras' Saratoga man. He was living at \textit{Kanathér}. As for my Mayawa man, who was our protector, he was feeding bushfowls at \textit{Téférisam}. There used to be a stone bridge there. That stone bridge went across from one side to the other side, from one side of the river to the other side. As for that Sangara, he was feeding Saratoga fishlings there in the swamp, at the \textit{Kanathér} side. Okay, that other one, the Mayawa story man, who was feeding the bushfowls, he lived at \textit{Téférisam}. He was feeding the bushfowls there, very small bushfowls.

They had a place for a (fish) trap, one for each. The Saratoga man had his at \textit{Kanathér}. He placed his fish basket by the stone bridge. The fish went inside that whatchamacallit, inside the fish basket. The other man placed his fish basket at \textit{Téférisam}, but he wasn't catching big fish. He was eating only the smaller ones. It was the one at \textit{Kanathér}, the Sangara story man, who was eating the really big ones.

One day, the bushman set off from \textit{Téférisam}. As he was making his way, the (other man's) parrot was sitting above. He was always talking like this: ``Oh, there is a man coming.'' Get ready! Hide the fish!'' While he was coming, the parrot called out. When he arrived, the Saratoga man had hidden the fish already. (The Bushfowl man asked) ``My friend, what is this oven for?'' (The Saratoga man replied:) ``No, I made yamcake yesterday. This is yesterday's oven.'' He deceived him badly. He was doing this to him again and again. (The bushfowl man) thought to himself ``Ah, my friend is tricking me because there were large fish bones lying around. Next time I will walk along the high ground.'' This time he was coming from the high ground to \textit{Kanathér}. He departed from \textit{Téferisam} (and walked) until he arrived there. As he was approaching the place, he was startled seeing those saratoga fishlings. (He said) ``These are my friend's saratoga fishlings.'' He began to kill those saratoga fishlings there in the swamp. He finished them off. He only took one with him. The parrot arrived late, only after he already got there. He said (to the Saratoga man) ``My friend, what oven is this?'' He was speechless. They said nothing at all, because they were surprised about the fish oven. Anyway, they wrestled each other. He threw away the saratoga fishling. (He said) ``You have tricked me. You fed the saratoga fish at your place.'' They pulled each other and hit each other. They were fighting and fighting. Next the Saratoga man came to \textit{Téférisam}, and now he was killing those bushfowls over there in Téférisam. He also took one and carried it away. ``What are doing you to my children?'' The Bushfowl man got up.

That stone bridge at \textit{Kanathér} that sticks out (of the water) a little bit, he started destroying it. The Saratoga man said to his wife: ``Let's go to Garaita. We will move to \textit{Théfén}.'' The stone bridge was just about to disappear when the Saratoga man went across to \textit{Théfén}, to that Sangara place and he went down at \textit{Garaita}. Nowadays, he stays there at \textit{Théfén}. As for ours, the Masu people's guy, that Bushfowl man, he was coming back, he returned. He packed up his belongings at Téférisam and set off and walked to Masu. Then he arrived at \textit{Masu}.

Okay, his little story ends right here. It is not a long story. Okay, that is why these two, the Sangaras at \textit{Garaita} and the Masu Mayawas, give each other sisters. They give them (sisters) from here as exchange women and in return they give them to us to be exchanged. The story ends right here. It was a short story. Thank you for listening. Thank you.
