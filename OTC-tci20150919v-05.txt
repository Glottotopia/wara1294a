I will start now. As for me, I was born there. My village is there, close to \textit{Wämnefér}. There is a lagoon by the river there. Okay, there is a small village on the side. There are coconuts and mango trees there. When my late father was still alive, we used to live there. One day, my father passed away and only my mothers were left, and the two of us. My big sister is from another father. She lives up in \textit{Kiunga}. Okay, I am just a little younger.

One day my mother, this old woman right here, she went with me to the swamp not far away. Maybe as far as the Mission station from there. So we walked there. As for my mother, this old woman here, she went hunting. She killed animals. She hunted cassowaries. She hunted deer. She hunted wallabies. Okay, so the two of us went hunting. We set off. The dogs started (chasing) a pig. There is a funny bit in this story. Then we walked and walked and the dogs started (chasing) the pig. The late mother said to us: ``You climb up!'' My big sister lifted up (on the tree). I couldn't climb then. So she put me up, maybe up to this height. She put me up on the Zürémb tree. There stood some Zürémb trees on the side. At my place there were some Zürémb trees on the side of that paperbark grove. Then my big sister put me on top because she was afraid. She put me up because she was that (the pig) might bite me. So she put me up, and she climbed up herself. But the old woman went for it.

My mother behaved more like a man. This little old woman had the strength of a man. She didn't care about (the dangers of) a cassowary, a wallaby or a pig. When she went for those, she killed them with an axe.

So these dogs started chasing the pig. The old woman followed them. The dogs chased it towards her. The old woman stepped aside so that the pig wouldn't bite her. She whacked it right on the head. The pig fell over and curled up.

We were both sitting there in the tree. I really had to go for a shit. So I was shitting from the tree top. Mother came, both mothers in fact! (They asked) ``Where are you two?'' ``Hey, over here!'' big sister replied. Her name is Nancy by the way. ``She's just shat herself. We're up here in the tree.'' ``You come down! The pig is lying dead over there.'' Then mum lifted me poor chap down. My sister came down and we walked over to the place where the pig lay.

Mother said to us ``Pile up some firewood! We will burn off the fur and then go back to the house.'' Then we walked around (collecting firewood) and then returned to pig. Mum and big sister chopped firewood. They piled up the fire and we started to burn the pig's hair off. Mum slaughtered it and we set off back to the village. We lived there for a long time. We were there until my sister grew older. I was as old as Ester there, as old as your namesake Bäi's daughter there. (That's how old) I became.

My two mothers went hunting together. Sometimes she went hunting by herself. She hunted for wallabies, deer or pigs. The other mother then took care of us two children. The other mother was from \textit{Sota}. But this mother here was from \textit{Fethkakar}, from the \textit{Garaita} side over there. We grew older and I was about as old as Lisa. We lived there until, we moved back here to this village. There is an abandoned village over there close to \textit{Yokwa}.

One day she set off again. She went right in the middle of the forest and started hunting a cassowary with her dogs. The cassowary charged at her and pierced this (leg). She still had a white scar, where it wounded her. When she came back, she was limping. She had killed the cassowary with the help of the dogs, but she had to leave it there. She was walking back slowly. She said to the other mother ``The cassowary is lying there. I killed it already! It has pierced (my leg) and I almost stepped on these (sharp) bamboos.'' The poor mother was wounded on the leg by the cassowary. This is how mother has provided for us, only the two mothers, no one else was helping us.

Time went by until 1968. We left that place. Mum accompanied us. She enrolled my sister in school. I was still a young girl back then. I was about the same age as Lisa. The old woman accompanied me. As for the other mother, she moved to \textit{Wämnefér}. She had an adopted son, who took care of her there. That brother has passed away already. My father had adopted him. So we departed and moved to \textit{Zäzér Ménz}. That's on the road to \textit{Safés}, on the side towards the river. They their to enroll us in the Mission school, but that didn't work. So we didn't go to school.

In 1968, we moved away from there. We came here. They told us ``There is no school here anymore. It has moved to \textit{Morehead}.'' So we came to \textit{Kanathér} and crossed river there, where that one lives, where Ben was living. There used to be these food houses. It was accommodation for the workers there. We walk there, we went across the river and we slept there. Then they enrolled us in school. I went to school on some days, but on other days I didn't. Sometimes my mother carried me there on her shoulders. She would always drop me off a \textit{Morehead} station, at the school. I wasn't very interested in school. I was like a ``wild'' girl, or whatever they call those who live in the forest. We used to live in the bush. We did not live in a proper house. My mothers lived in the bush. They took me out of school. Only my big sister went and she did well in school. But it was different with me. Some days, she really had to carry me to the school. Then she waited there for me and brought me back. We returned to \textit{Kanathér}. She was carrying me there during prep school, and in grade one, and she did the same in second grade.

They built a house in \textit{Kanathér}, where we lived. No one supported me with money (for the school fee). My mother would go fishing, she sold the fish at the market. She then used this money to buy second-hand clothes. She didn't mind doing all these things. ``Oh, no (problem). I will do that for her.'' is what she was saying. She was doing this. She always listened to me, to what I told her. She did all those things for me.

Then my big sister finished school. A pastor from Moresby took her, and she stayed with him in Port Moresby. Then mum took care only of me up until 1973. I finished grade 6 in 1973. They selected me for high school. I looked for (financial) support, but nobody helped me. I told mother ``Nevermind, we'll stay here. We are going to live here and I will look after you.'' 

Time went by until father came. He used to work in Kiunga. There was a party, that's another funny story. They were having a party in Garaita. Father was standing there with a guitar. I picked him (thinking) ``This one will be my husband.'' Then we were living in \textit{Kanathér}. Father visited us there. Other days, we went for a visit. Then he was about to return (to \textit{Kiunga}). That was the time, when we got engaged. They exchanged us. The exchange man came from here. He was working in \textit{Oriomo}. The late old father said to me: ``Okay, he will marry her as an exchange.'' So they arranged everything and talked where this watchamacallit stands, that wari tree. Do they call it wari? No, it's the one that stands in \textit{Kanathér} on this side, where the mämbü tree grows.

They built a sitting platform and some people came from \textit{Garaita}. The exchange woman's family came to \textit{Garaita}. Their late old father and the exchange man came to this place. Then we got married there.

Then in 1975, father took me to \textit{Kiunga}. I looked like a small girl in a dress when he brought me there. When they saw us, they wondered ``Who's that? It that his small sister or what?'' ``No, she is my wife!'' Then we lived there. A year later, father had hit some woman there. Father was a bad guy then, really a short-tempered guy. You shouldn't make any mistakes with him. He had hit that woman and they took him to \textit{Rumginae} prison. When he returned, we got on the boat (to go back down the Fly River). I had some chickens and all those things. We returned for good then.

I have been staying here in the village. When I returned from there, I stayed at \textit{Kanathér} with old mother. I've been living here until today. I was thinking of continuing school, but nobody helped with the school fee. That's really why I forgot about it and stayed in the village. My main occupation is sharing food with people in need. God has blessed me in this way. That's how I live today. I have lived at \textit{Kanathér}, then \textit{Masu} and now \textit{Rouku}.

I have become an old woman now. But I was also taking the old woman (my mother) around. She became weaker until one day (she died). She passed away only recently, while you were away. In her last weeks, the poor old woman was lying down most of the time.

That's my little story. Thank you.
