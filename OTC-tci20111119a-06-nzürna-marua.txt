Okay, I'll start talking to you now. I will start the Nzürna story for you. The place (is) \textit{Rouku}. The people were living in \textit{Yambär}. They slept in \textit{Yambär}. There is a creek is at \textit{Dimsathak}. The men and the women went off for poison root fishing. There was one man who had two wives. The child, a girl, was still young, maybe like this. Her mothers went ahead, while the father stayed in \textit{Rouku}. The girl followed behind.

The Nzürna lived in the big forest of \textit{Wataya} on the \textit{Masu} side. She came this way with her fish net catching fish at the creek, small fish, the \textit{ŋarufay} fish. She was catching those ones. The small girl was walking past, when they saw each other. The Nzürna called out to her: ``Come over! Come here! The others are already far ahead. Let's stay here. We will poison this (creek) right here.'' She was deceiving her badly, pretending to be one of her mothers. She said to her ``You go over there! Try to chase (the fish) this way!'' The Nzürna caught small fish with her net. She caught them until (the fish net) was full. The Nzürna ate them up quickly. She gulped down the whole fish. They walked to another bend in the creek. She caught them and again ``nom nom nom'' (she swallowed them). The little girl looked at her (and thought) ``This is not my mother. This is a Nzürna.'' The Nzürna was leading her further into the forest at \textit{Wataya}. Then she said ``You go a bit further over there!'' The girl went to another bend (in the creek). The girl started digging up the mud in the water. The water that flowed towards the Nzürna was completely muddy. The girl quickly ran off towards the road. She got there and ran away.

She arrived at her father's place in the afternoon. ``Father, look at me! The Nzürna is chasing me. I just caught fish together with the Nzürna.'' Her father ran off and brought all the people together in the afternoon. ``This happened and then this happened.'' She told them. Her mothers were still out at the creek, at the netting place. Well, when the mothers came back, the father chased one wife. She was still carrying the fish. He hit her with the bow. Then he chased the other wife, and he also hit her with the bow. ``That little girl (was out alone). It was already getting late in the day.'' Then they put two girls of the same age in the yam house (and told them to be) very quiet at the back of the house. They twisted the (girls') hair and tied them together. They wrapped them up and covered them with mats and put yams on top. That's how they left them.

The Nzürna had already arrived. She leaned against the banana tree. She was watching them from there. The people (brought out) their drums, grass skirts, headdresses, etc. They surrounded the house while they were dancing: ``bang bang bang bang bang'' The Nzürna began to throw fine soil at them. She made people sleepy. Until they were done. They feel asleep. She went and tore open the house. She went inside and looked at the (two girls). ``Not this one'', she said, ``but this is the one.'' She untied their hair and carried one (of the girls) to the door. (As for the other girl,) she first pulled out one eye and then the other. Then she pushed her hand in her arse and pulled out the intestines. Then she ate her (intestines). The people were fast asleep. What are you laughing at? While the people were sleeping, she ate her up. Then she hung the (remaining) guts on a post. She only took her head to \textit{Wataya}.

What's the name of that tree? To (her) Wäsi tree. Then she climbed inside her own house. Her husband looked at her (and said), ``Oh, what trouble have you been in? You have eaten a human!'' The husband took off and ran this way. There is another forest over there. He was scared and moved away to \textit{Tauri Kufak}. The people woke up (and realized) ``They are gone! that girl is gone!'' They only saw the guts hanging from the post. They choose their best sorcerers. They went after her (until they found the tree). ``Oh, she's in here!'' Then they wrapped up the wäsi tree with their magic spells. They piled firewood at the base and burned it. It burned and burned and burned and burned. The Nzürna was looking outside ``Oh, there is fire!'' She tried to put out the fire by peeing on it, but that didn't work. She tried to spray the fire with her shit, but that didn't work either. She threw the human skull at the fire to extinguish it, but that didn't work. She burned completely with the tree and everything else. Eventually the tree fell. Well, that \textit{kukakuka} bird was just about to call out, when the (sorcerers) grabbed (and burned) it. They ground up the charcoal remains (of her) until everything was gone. The story is finished now. That was the Nzürna story. Infact, it is not a Nzürna story, but a real story. They later changed it into a Nzürna story. Okay, it is finished now.

A real story, yes, they made it into a Nzürna story, they changed it. It is like the (Nzürna story) about Bres. The Nzürna ate a small girl (just like) she ate Bres. This one was an adult, but she was a small child. (It happened) at Wataya here. That Nzürna came from the \textit{Masu} side.
