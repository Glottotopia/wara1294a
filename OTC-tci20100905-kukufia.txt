My name is Abia. I am from \textit{Rouku}. My father was Bäi. I'm going to tell you a story about what's-his-name. The short man's name was Kukufia. Kukufia lived in \textit{Masu}. He had two wives. There was another man who lived here in \textit{Rouku}. He had one wife. He set off to cut down a sago palm. The name of that place is \textit{Karesa Zfth}. While he was there at \textit{Karesa Zfth}, he left his two children here, the older girl and younger boy.

One day, Kukufia set off to go fishing. He went down to the river to paddle his canoe and look for fish. He had his harpoon to spear fish. He put the things in the canoe. He got into the canoe and set off. He paddled all the way to the \textit{Mnzärfr}. This is a place on the riverbank. Then he left the canoe there and started to walk up here. When he came up, he shouted. He called his name ``Kukufia Kukufia Kukufia''. In the absence of their father, the little children heard this. ``Little brother, there's a man shouting!'' The two were there in the house, in the sleeping house, in the big house. Then Kukufia approached. He asked them, ``Hey, who are you in the house? Who are you in there?'' The little ones didn't answer. They gave no answer. He approached the house and knocked hard. He knocked on the other side. The little children came out. The big girl and the small boy. He took them to the riverbank there. Then they got into the canoe. The little girl paddled the canoe. Her little brother sat in the centre of the canoe. Kukufia stood there with his harpoon, looking for fish. Then he speared a \textit{kwazür} fish. With the \textit{kwazür} spines, he pricked the little boy. With those three spines on the \textit{kwazür}, he poked him with those. From there they paddled a little further and he shot a catfish. They paddled until Kaftfr and then returned from there. The boy must have cried because of the pain. But Kukufia wasn't paying attention. They paddled back to the canoe place at \textit{Mnzärfr}. From there, he brought them back. He sent the little children away and he returned to \textit{Masu} by canoe. He came up from the river and showed his wives the fish. He continued this over the course of three days.

One day the children's father came from \textit{Karesa Zfth}. Their mother had sent him. In the meantime, the boy was in pain, physical pain from the fish spines. Their father came looking for them. The children stayed in fear in the house, inside the sleeping house. Then the children replied: ``Father, we little children are here!'' The father came and saw them. He said: ``Oh, so that's what is going on! Where did that man come from?'' ``No, he came from \textit{Masu}. His name is Kukufia.'' Kukufia came back that afternoon. He left his canoe at the swamp near \textit{Mnzärfr} and came up from river. He started to bully the children, over and over again. They did not react. The father was under the house. He had covered himself with banana leaves. Then the father stood up. While the children were distracting Kukufia, he shot him from there. Kukufia ran off with the arrow in his body. He ran all the way to \textit{Masu}. He changed (his appearance). It was his wife, the second one, the latter wife, on whose breast he clung (as a baby). The father followed the blood trail from \textit{Zöfäthak} to \textit{Masu}. There he asked the two wives: ``Where is your husband?'' ``He's not here. He's run away. He's gone.'' Then he asked ``Who's that supposed to be? It's this child! The little baby is him!'' The father smashed the baby against a tree and beat both women to death. Then he returned to \textit{Zöfäthak}, to \textit{Rouku}. He fetched the wife from \textit{Karesa Zfth} and brought her back to the children.

Well, that is the end story of the story. It was a short story. Thank you very much.
