(The story is) like this. This story is an old story, our father's (story). It's the fathers' story. It dates back to the time when people didn't yet know what matches were. When those matches first appeared here, they came from the Torres Strait Islands. There weren't many people who owned and used them. Only a few people really knew about them.

At this time, there was a feast in \textit{Forzitho}. There was a dance and people from here went there. They had also invited people from Smärki. There was one man from \textit{Forzitho}. He had exchanged wives with those ones. He might have been from whatchamacallit, a man from \textit{Koréth}. Another name for that place is \textit{Méngte}. Well, so they came for the dance. It is customary to a pig and kill it (for the dance). This is the way. As they came to \textit{Forzitho}, they brought the dance into the village and they danced until midnight. The whole night passed and it was almost dawn. That was when they burned the bark. When they burned the bark it was the \textit{Forzitho} man, his exchange man, who was talking. He burnt (the torch). They were talking angrily. He got into an argument with his exchange man.

He had previously put a box of matches in his pocket, in his clothes, in the bag. As he talked himself into a rage, this man from \textit{Forzitho}, he took out the matchbox. He pulled it out and got one match. It wasn't one of these lighters. Nowadays, there are cigarette lighters, not this type or lighter. These were real matches. These were match sticks. So the man from \textit{Forzitho} took one match out. He held up the matchbox on one side with his hand. He held the match stick in his other hand. He was talking angrily ``When I take this out, it will start the real fire, the \textit{kidn} fire!'' They used to call the mythical fire sometimes \textit{kidn}. When people saw this, they got scared. They were thinking like this: This \textit{kidn} is from long time ago, when the earth was created, when god made the earth. This \textit{kidn} fire was hidden at the time. There was a bird named \textit{tütü}, that \textit{tütü} bird that was calling out today. She was hiding the \textit{kidn} fire.

The people heard him talk like this ``Now I'm going to use them and we're all going to burn! I call these matches or matchbox.'' As he took out the matches, the people ran off in all directions. They were afraid of this small matchbox. All the people who had come to the dance ran away. They forgot about the pig, the food and everything else. They all were really scared. (He continued) ``When I light this up, when it strikes, all the people will burn here.''They were afraid. So they said: ``Get him, hold him! He could start the fire and we'll all burn.'' A few men came and tied up his hands. They took the fire from him, the matchbox really. He said: ``Now you're feeling it! This is what will happen if you make fun of me.'' Others almost broke their feathers (on their headdresses) and smashed their drums. They ran away in fear because of these matches. Then they took (the matchbox) away from him and they sat him down. (They said) ``Why are you doing this? We all could have burnt, all the little children and the old women. Who shall live from now on?'' They sat him down properly. They poured him some kava to calm his anger. They bottled him with kava. He was lying there drunk out of his mind. They put an end to his angry thoughts.

Then they started the dance again up until the morning hours. They killed the pig and slaughtered it. They distributed the meat, the sago and whatever else was there. Then the Smärki people went back. They left \textit{Forzitho} village for good. That \textit{kidn} fire was just with that one guy.

These matchboxes were only recently introduced by the whites. The white people from Autralia brought these matches with them. People then found out that they call them matches. They have nothing do with the \textit{kidn} fire. This small fire is used for smoking tobacco or making a fire. It is for these things. But in the past, people were afraid. They were really scared (wondering) ``Is it a bomb or could it be a bomb?'' That's how it was. The old people did not really know about those things at the time. Our fathers did not know and they did not go to school. There was no knowledge about this. Nothing was known about this. They did not know about it, so they were afraid of it. It was their first time to see matches.

That was the small story about these small matches. They used to call these \textit{kidn} fire or \textit{zfth} fire. The old people used to call matches by those terms. Thank you all for listening. Thank you!
