Should I tell you the story in Komnzo or in English? I will tell it in Komnzo. Okay then. A long time ago, there were not many people. No matter how many people there were on earth, people came here then. Some people were living in \textit{Mongarkam}. \textit{Mongarkam} is a village. Okay, others lived in \textit{Firra}. Still others lived in the places where their respective villages were located.

Inside \textit{Firra}, there was a Nzürna, who lived there. The Nzürna lived together with her husband. Her husband's name was Nangawa. He was a bit of a small guy. As for his wife, that Nzürna's name was Zafo. They lived together. Where they really lived was in a Wäsü tree. Their house was inside the big Wäsü tree. They were inside the hole (at the bottom of the tree). That was their house where they lived. Many other people lived in \textit{Firra}. When the people spread out, when they left the village, to attend their gardens, or to go hunting, or when they stayed overnight somewhere, that Nzürna took over their place. She came (to the village). When she saw rubbish lying around, when the people had left their belongings scattered around and there was rubbish everywhere, she would grab the broom and sweep the place. She cleared their house yards. Sometimes their things were scattered around and she put everything back in the right order. She put those things back in the house for them, (for example) small pieces of firewood. Then she returned to her own house. When the people came back again, the house owners said: ``Oh, this woman was here. She has swiped the house yard here.'' At that time, they knew about their connections to her, but only the people from this particular village. They were on good terms with the Nzürna. She did not attack the people from the village, because they were her friends. They knew about her. They were like her children and she looked after them.

One day, there was a man from \textit{Mongarkam}, who came for a visit to \textit{Firra}. He spoke Nama language. The people living in \textit{Firra} were speakers of Mema. In those times, when people still lived (at \textit{Firra}). Okay, as he came (to \textit{Firra}) the parrot was calling out ``krara krara krara''. He arrived in \textit{Firra} inside the banana grove ``krara krara krara''. He quickly changed his appearance. He changed into a human being. Those long eyebrows and whatever else was there disappeared. He changed his appearance and became a human being. Then the Nzürna saw him and said: ``Come closer, my dear friend! Where did you just come from?'' He was thinking like this: ``Oh, they must have left this old woman behind. Nobody else is here. They have all gone out. They must have gone down to the river.'' He said: ``Okay then!'' She spread out a mat for him and went and knocked down some bananas for him. She gave him (the bananas). Bad thoughts arose in her mind: ``This guy will be my meal. He's here already.'' She realised that the man was not from this village. ``Where might he have come from?'' She began to woo him. ``You're not going back today? The sun has almost set there.'' He replied ``No, I will sleep here. I'll wait until the people come back tomorrow.''

In the evening, they spread their sleeping mats and went to sleep. The man was fast asleep. But the Nzürna woke up (and called out) ``züm züm züm züm'' She was trying to wake him up, to give him a sign. He slept soundly and didn't move. She took the yamstick, struck him on the head and killed him. Then she ate him right there. (She ate) everything. Only the intestines, she carried to the Füni tree that stands in \textit{Firra}. The name of the tree is Füni. It's there in \textit{Firra}. If you walk there day, you will see that big tree. Ah, you've already been there? It is right by the road. She rammed the yamstick in the ground and hung the intestines from it, that man's intestines. Then she returned and went inside her house. Her husband asked her: ``What have you been up to? Where do you come from? Where did you stay?'' (She replied) ``Nowhere! I slept there during the night. Nightfall caught me during work (for the children). They had left their things lying around.'' Her husband was unsuspecting.

When the villagers arrived they looked around (and said) ``Something bad has happened. Where did the man she ate come from?'' In the evening, they went to her house. They argued with her and talked to her. As they returned to the village they were saying, ``What should we do with her? Has she already finished the man? She just ate him.'' There were some sorcerers who lived in \textit{i}. There were getting prepared. They were getting prepared for her and they came up with a plan, ``We will burn her in the fire.'' This was the plan. They began to block their thoughts with their magic. They blocked her mind until she did not dare come out of her house because they had intimidated her. She was scared (thinking), ``They already know what I've done.'' They piled up firewood by the entrance (to her house). They piled up wood and set it on fire. Meanwhile, she was busy weaving a mat in her tree. Her poor husband woke up and hear the sound of the fire ``uh'' The big Wäsü tree stood in a bamboo grove at \textit{Waisam}. That's the name of the place, \textit{Waisam}, where she lived. It is located in the middle of a bamboo grove. Her husband got up asked her: ``What have you done yesterday?'' (She replied) ``What do you mean, what did I do?'' ``and what's this sound? Oh no!'' (She realized) ``My poor place, the wind is blowing. This is the sound of the fire (in the bamboos). It's the sound of the wind. It's coming from my village.'' It was the fire that started burning earlier.

The poor husband was looking for an escape. He got out. The fire was very close. So he left her alone and jumped out like this. He jumped and took off. He was running for his life. He ran away for good. Their daughters were staying in Ote at the time. That place still exists. It's place with a story of its own. That place is in the middle of some dödö trees. So he escaped to Ote and informed the daughters, ``Your mother burned in the flames there. It was all her fault! She did a big crime. She ate a man.'' He went away for good.

The fire was still burning. It burned and burned. She tried to find a way, ``Where will I get out? Where?'' Everything burned down. It burned until all was over. Only her spirit tried to escaped by entering into a bird. The one that is calling out ``kuka kuka'' over there. But the sorcerers shot the kukakuka bird and it fell to the ground. They burned this bird and finished her off. The fire then went out.

Nangawa returned to check on things. ``Is she still alive or did she burn in the fire?'' He returned to \textit{Waisam} where he saw the Wäsü tree. He said: ``Well, it was all her fault.'' He wept profusely for his wife there. Then he returned for good. This man lives now in Ote together with the daughters. You can still see him there from time to time. We sometimes see him when he crosses the river to go to \textit{Firra} and when comes back again. He is a small man.

That was the Nzürna's story, the one who lived in \textit{Firra}. She has done many other things, but this one thing she has done in public. She ate a man from another village, a man from \textit{Mongarkam}. This is the end of the story about that Nzürna. I have told it now. There are other stories at other places. There are other Nzürna stories, but the villagers there know them. I followed this one because we know it. This happened in our village, where our fathers lived. And the fathers told us about it. I have finished it (the story) here in this way. I am done.
