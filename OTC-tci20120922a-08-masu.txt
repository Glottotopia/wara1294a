I will start the story about \textit{Masu}. We started walked and came from \textit{Yambär}, to \textit{Tratrambäk}, to \textit{Méndri}, and now to \textit{Masu} right here.

This is the village of \textit{Masu}, where our ancestor first arrived. The ancestors came one by one, each clan. There were different ancestors of the Mayawa, the Bangu, and the Sangara. They were looking for their way when they came. They were looking for a place where they could settle down. Our ancestor came to this place here. He came from \textit{Komo} and he crossed over the creek at \textit{Swänze}. That log bridge is still there, where he went across. Then he came right here. He heard the butcherbird calling out: ``This is a place on the high ground.'' He looked at the place, and he gave the name \textit{Masu} to it. Then he continued further saying: I will try and walk a little further''" He got to Faremkar, when he heard the butcherbird again: ``There is a settlement there.'' He walked further and he looked around ``Someone has settled here already.'' The ancestors of the Farem clan had settled down there first, from the Farem clan at the center Faremkar, from Bres and Orot's lingeage. Their ancestor had settled there first. Others like the Wazu clan and Muthérata clan settled on the side (of \textit{Faremkar}). They have named places of their own there, for example \textit{Wazu} right beside \textit{Faremkar}. And there is \textit{Muthérata} on the other side. And on the other side, in this direction, is \textit{Fisor Béthan}. That was the place from where our ancestor returned. He must have looked (and said) ``Someone has settled here already.'' So he only named that place \textit{Fisor Béthan}, and then he returned here to \textit{Masu}. This is the story place right here. Our ancestor settled down right here, the ancestor of the Masu-Mayawas. There are two families: Mérzar-Mayawa and Banibani-Mayawa. He settled down right here. His house was right here.

This is a high place. When the water level rises in the rainy season, this place is not affected by the water. Only other places are inundated, not \textit{Masu} here. This is why they call us Masu people. We are the Masu people. It is based on this place \textit{Masu}. There used to be a dense forest here. They cut down the forest to create gardens. Today there is no more forest here, only savannah grass. It used to be a thick forest. In our fathers generation, there were only few people. All the way back. There were only a few people in the generation of our ancestors and fathers. They made us what we are today. And we are now many people. We are still gardening here, right here, in this place. At the moment we are leaving this place alone (to grow back), and we (have gardens) there at \textit{ŋazäthe}, where we also have some land. We have a small piece of land there. When we have used up the land there, we will return here. We have already started to bring back the gardens back here this season. We have built some storage houses there. Next, we start with the actual design of the gardens, and we build the fence.

This is the story about \textit{Masu}. This place here is \textit{Masu}, and that is why they called us Masu people. We are the Masu people. The story ends like this.

CD asks: Why did the people leave this place?

The people left because, when they were living here first, there was no government. The people used to live in their respective groups in small settlements, where their respective ancestors had settled. They were living in this way: We were here at \textit{Masu}, and those other people lived on the other side of the river, for example in \textit{Mibini} and \textit{Akrimogo}. There were small settlements like \textit{Safés}. Others lived in \textit{Kwaikér}. Others lived like this in \textit{Mefath}. When the white man came, he wanted to bring us together in one place. So we built larger villages. The Masu people went to \textit{Rouku} for good, likewise those ones from \textit{ŋazäthe}, \textit{Faremkar}, and \textit{Démändér}. We came together in one village. We built one big village, that's \textit{Rouku}. Before we were like this, we lived individually. This clan lived over there and that clan lived over there, and that other clan lived over there. We were staying in the clan. We saw each other from a distance. When the white man came, when the gospel came, it also brought whatchamacallit, it brought unity. That's when we really met up regularly. We became friends. That's how we still live today. So that is reason why we live like this, why we live in one village. As for the places where our ancestor had settled (first), our story man, we have left these places, and instead we moved to one village. This was how the story goes. This is really our place here, \textit{Masu}, where our ancestor settled down first.  Other clans also have their (places) with their stories. It is just like this! Thank you!
