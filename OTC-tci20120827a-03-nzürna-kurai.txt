Good morning! I'll begin another story about Bres. Okay, Bres was living in \textit{Yirko}. He had two wives. One wife was from \textit{Kanfok} and the other was from Masu. Neither of those two women had children. Bres was a hunter, a night hunter. He used to go this way, to \textit{Kwonä Trkr} and to \textit{Débäwéth}. Okay, there was a Nzürna living in \textit{Débäwéth}. One day he had set a whatchmacallit, a trap with a bamboo string. He went early in the morning. He caught wallaby, pig and cassowary. He carried them back to the house. The two wives cooked them in the oven.

One day all the Farem people went for a dance at \textit{Kanfok}. It was a nzürna dance. Bres' wives followed the others to that dancing place. They left Bres and the old woman behind. After the women had left, (Bres) went off to check his traps in the morning. He took out a wallaby, a deer and a pig. He prepared the oven and piled up firewood. He made that oven in \textit{Débäwéth}. He stayed over there. He burnt off the fur. That was when the Nzürna appeared. She called out to him ``My child, what are you doing?'' Bres saw her (and thought) ``Hey, my mother told me about this one, about this nzürna who is moving around here. ``You be careful!'' is what she told me.''

He told her ``You take the intestines and wash them in the water!'' She carried all to the water. The stream of water almost tore them out of her hands. So she ate them (intestines) raw. She swallowed them down. She shouted ``Bres come quickly! The water current carries them away.'' Bres ran towards her, but the guts were gone. He thought ``She just ate them.'' Bad thoughts arose in his mind. They closed up the oven. They threw out (the little pieces of wood). They covered the wallaby meat. Okay, the Nzürna said, ``I'll pick your lice out.'' Bres laid down. She was holding his head like this, and tried to pull out his eyeballs. The Nzürna was trying to kill him, to eat him really. He said ``Old woman, why are you doing this?'' She replied ``No, here are lice in your eyes.'' Then he told her: ``You go and fetch some water for me from Débäwéth. Break some bamboos after that!'' ``Okay, I will do that.'' She walked of, but she hid behind a tree. She leaned (against the tree) and pissed in the container for him. She brought the urine for him and said ``Here you go.'' He smelled it and said ``No you just pissed into it. Go again! and smash the bamboos too.'' She walked away and really hit the bamboo on her head.

Meanwhile, Bres began to open the oven. He grabbed some of the wallaby meat and quickly wrapped them up. He left some of the meat behind and he ran towards the house at Yirko. He thought of his mother, the poor, old woman. As he ran off, the Nzürna arrived (back at the oven). Whatever bark and stones were lying around, she swallowed them. The Nzürna swallowed it all down. She finished it all. She swallowed the wallaby meat and the fresh leaves (in the oven) and the leaves that bres was sitting on. She swallowed these. She began to follow him. She called out, ‘Bres, put down some wallaby meat for me!’ Bres put one wallby leg up on the branch for her and she gulped it down. They kept doing this until they approached the house.

Okay, Bres said to the old woman: ``Mother, the Nzürna is after me.'' The old woman said to him: ``That's why I told you not to go to this side.'' The old woman was doing this, she pulled apart a big pile of yams. She said to him: ``You lie down here!'' She covered him up and finshed this. She closed the door properly with a string and left him there. She sat down by the fire. at the house door really. Then (the Nzürna) arrived and said ``Oh dear friend!'' The old woman and the Nzürna began to fight. She hit her with the digging stick ``What pain are you giving me? Bring out my child! He is in here.'' The old woman replied ``No, I don't have any children.'' They began to fight and kept on fighting until the Nzürna send in a centipede. It bit Bres on the back and he yelled ``aaah''. The Nzürna cut the string and went inside. She said, ``You lead the way!'' Bres came out. She pulled out the worm (from his guts) and then, she ate him. She returned back home with a full stomach and left the old woman in tears. She was crying badly. Okay, this (part of the story) is finished.

The two women were at the dancing place at \textit{Kanfok}. While they were there, they realized something had happened. They suddenly had to pee. ``Is our husband okay or not?'' They asked each other ``Are you okay?'' ``No, I am the same (like you). I've already wet myself.'' ``We'll get going.'' They left during the night. They came to \textit{Mät Kar}. They arrived at the place there and found old woman in tears. She said ``Your husband is inside. He is sitting here. The Nzürna has just eaten him.''

They went (to inform) the people. They came together. There were sorcerers here. They practiced their magic in \textit{Yirko}. Then they led the others to the place where the Nzürna lived. Men and women came along. They stacked firewood by the Wäsi tree, while she stayed in house in the tree. Then they set it on fire. She heard the sound of the fire. She was saying ``The wind is coming from my place.'' She shouted ``ŋokä''. She was saying those (magic) words. She thought it must be the wind, but it was the sound of the smoke rising. The fire was burning on this Wäsi tree. The flames shocked her up there (in the tree). The flames reached her and she threw out the mat. She threw out the children. She tried in vain to piss on the fire. She threw all her children into the fire. Nzürna's husband, the old man, had already fled. Earlier when she had arrived with a full stomach, he asked: ``Are you okay? What is with you stomach? There was a man is walking along here. You might have killed him!'' She replied ``What? Did you get any meat for the children? You just go to sleep!'' Okay, she finally threw herself into the fire and burned to death. The sorcerers caught her spirit. They blocked her mind also.

Today we are here. Our children are safe when they walk through the forest. In the past, the children didn't move around. It was a dangerous place. Human bones were lying around on the base of that Wäsi tree. She had eaten many people. There were pig bones, cassowary bones, wallaby bones and also human bones. He had eaten some people from Démändér and from Farem, that Nzürna woman. Okay, the story ends here. Thank you my friend. Thank you very much.

It is a good story. Others should not tell this story. It is mine. Bres was my ancestor. He was my greatgrandfather. This was a true thing (that happened). As for Bres' home, he was living in \textit{Yirko}. You can see my land at \textit{Yirko}, which extends like that. Thank you!
