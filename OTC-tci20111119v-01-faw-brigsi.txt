Good morning! In this nice morning, I will tell the story, how they killed them at \textit{Téndöfi}, where they cut off peoples' heads, and how they took revenge for the attack on \textit{Firra} village.

They discussed their plans before the revenge attack. Ote and Yasi did that. They planned it in \textit{Tamnzüfi}. \textit{Tamnzüfi} lies on the other side of the river in the Fothér forest. They agreed on a plan to take revenge on them, to revenge their clan people, who were killed at \textit{Firra}, against those who had killed Srank. When they did so, they allied themselves with (the people of) Mogarkam. Some of their elders were living there. Likewise with \textit{Fethkakar}, they also allied themselves with them, some came from here, some of their elders were from the Farem people. So they had formed an alliance at that time. Next the headhunters walked from here to whatchamacallit, to \textit{Tämnzüfi}. They gathered there and discussed things, how they will attack the people of \textit{Téndöfi}. A few people living in \textit{Téndöfi} were from Safés. They had formed an alliance in the attack on \textit{Firra}. This is really why they started the revenge there (in \textit{Téndöfi}).

So they gathered over there in \textit{Tämnzüfi}. They finished (their discussions) and got going. They went from \textit{Tämnzüfi} to \textit{Sazäthi}, From \textit{Sazäthi}, they took a shortcut to \textit{Térén Zäre}. From \textit{Térén Zäre} they walked to Käs. They gathered in Käs and sat closely together collecting the names (of their victims). They were breaking small sticks, they broke the branches like this, and they put a name to each stick. For this man's name they broke one stick, and for that man's name they broke another stick. They did this for as many people as lived on the other side of the river in \textit{Téndöfi}, for every woman, for the children and for the men.

There was one man (amongst the headhunters) who was from our clan, from this village here, from the Farem people. He had exchanged wives with the people from Safés, and (this family) was also there in \textit{Téndöfi}. So he told the others: ``My exchange man is staying there. My exchange woman is there. I will go ahead. I will tell my exchange man (what is going to happen).'' He followed the riverbank for a short distance, not far from \textit{Käs}. Then he called out for the canoe. As he was calling for the canoe, his exchange man heard him (and said) ``Oh, someone is calling for the canoe.'' Well, he looked like this, he was already dressed up wearing his headdress and he was carrying his bow and arrow. His exchange man came and he looked at him. He gave him tobacco, really strong tobacco. His exchange man was smoking it first, the one who went from here, the one who had come for killing them. Anyway, it was really strong tobacco. He gave him the tobacco and he puffed it. But he did not understand (the sign), and (thought) ``He gave me this strong tobacco. Why did he give me the strong tobacco?'' Later he was biting his tongue towards him. He bit (on his tongue) in an aggressive way. That's when his exchange man understood the message and thought ``This is a headhunter.'' They crossed the river there. He gave tobacco to his in-laws, to his brothers-in-law and they sat down. Then, his exchange told him, ``Let's say goodbye. I will set off now.'' As for those other poor guys, his exchange man did not tell them. Then he left like this, he crossed the river. But he knew that this one had come for an attack. He was spying on the people. So he told his wife ``We are going to leave!'' The exchange man told him: ``I will take the old canoe across and I will come back the day after tomorrow.'' They said goodbye to each other and his exchange man left. He went across and met the other headhunters. (He told tem) ``It is like this and like this. There are lots of men, women and children. My exchange man left already.''

Okay, there was an old man from \textit{Mongarkam}. They left only him behind (in the camp). He was the one who kept these small branches covered with a coconut shell. He had to push down the coconut shell. So he stayed behind. Using a coconut shell, he bewitched them with this spell. This action is called \textit{tmod}. One cannot move (the coconut shell). It keeps (the victims) suppressed with the spell. They brought short sticks and used them to secure the coconut shell in place. As for the poor people there, the ones in \textit{Téndöfi}, they simply slept soundly. They were very tired. So the (headhunters) waited and waited until it got late, until dawn. They sent out their spies first. They approached from the river and spied out the village from there. (They were talking:) ``Oh, these one are there and the other ones are there.'' With this (knowledge) they crossed the river. The whole group of headhunters from the Farem crossed over. Until everyone was there there. They cordoned off the entire village until they had sealed it off. That was when the attack began. They shot their arrows and began to fight. They killed them and killed them.

There was one older girl there. Old man Ote and Yasi chased her. They chased her down and grabbed her. She tried to tell them: ``Oh, I am one of your sisters.'' (They said) ``Oh, we'll take good care of you. We'll break your neck now!" They held her tight and pulled out their bamboo knives. But they did not manage to kill her. They just cut the neck. They tried to break this neck bone here. They didn't succeed and the poor girl struggled to free herself. In the meantime, the other headhunters had killed all the other villagers and they started to cross the river again. Only the big girl was still fighting (with the two men). They carried her away and threw her to the ground and tried to break her neck, (when one of them said) ``Oh brother, everyone is gone. They left us behind.'' They left the girl there. She was bleeding badly and gurgling from her throat. The two guys ran off. ``Hey!'' They gave a signal. The others answered them. They were on the other side with the canoe. The others crossed the river (and asked) ``What happened?'' (They replied) ``We left her half dead. We cut her throat with the bamboo knife. She'll just die up there.''

Then they took stock: ``Oh, we killed so and so many of them, not many. But they killed many of us.'' They slept and woke up in the morning. They rushed off and came to Sazäthi. Next, they came to \textit{Méndüfi}. This is where they would sing a headhunting song. ``Hey'', the old women and the grandmothers heard them (and said) ``They've already killed them. Now they're coming back singing.'' The women and some older women stood in a row, and they started jumping up and down holding their fishing nets. The (men) began to approach the village and held the heads and they began to whatchamacallit ... to put the heads in the fishing nets. They took them to the old people and finished (the ritual). Then they sat down and enjoyed themselves. They beat the big drum (to let everyone know). The people heard this (and said) ``They've killed them already. The Farem people, the Fethka people and the Mongarkam people killed them.'' That was the end of the revenge. 

Well, the headhunting story about those who were killed at \textit{Téndöfi} by the Farem, it has come to an end now. Thank you very much for listening!
